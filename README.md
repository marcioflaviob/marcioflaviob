## üìÅ Meet my projects

### - [Movie Curator](https://github.com/marcioflaviob/msfinder)
#### This website recommends you a movie based on a song.
Successfully integrated three APIs, including OpenAI's API to use artificial intelligence to find a movie that is similar to the chosen song.

### - [Email and SMS API](https://github.com/marcioflaviob/email-sms-sender)
#### An API that sends an email and SMS at the same time to someone.
It uses abstraction to change from one email sender provider to another if the first one fails.

### - [School Management Application](https://github.com/marcioflaviob/email-sms-sender)
#### A Spring Boot application that manages students and lessons.
This was a game-changer for managing my students and lessons when tutoring. It's super handy for keeping track of students, teachers, books, and lessons. The Spring Boot follows the MVC pattern for a solid and scalable setup
